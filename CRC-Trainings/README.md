# Trainings App for CRC course
**Author: Daniel Cogiel**

##### Running app

- You may test the app currently (*state for 23.05.2023*) hosted on [Vercel](https://trainings-test1.vercel.app/login)
- You may run app locally using `docker-compose up` command with *docker-compose.yml* file defined in *App* directory. Remember to specify environment variables in *.env* file in backend's root directory (details about variables are also listed in that folder's *README.md*) as well as *database.json* file in order to run app using this technology.
