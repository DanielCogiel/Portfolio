            Welcome, my name is Daniel Cogiel. I am a student of the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice and my not so 
            far away dream is to become Frontend Developer. I am developing my skills all the time and with each day I become better. 
            I am experienced in technologies such like <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript </strong>  
             and I also know <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>. I hope 
            that soon I will find the job of my dreams. Thank you for visiting this website!
