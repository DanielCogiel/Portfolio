            Among my many interests the most loved one is rock/metal music. It's my fuel in life. I really 
            like playing guitar, metal fashion, jewelry and all other things rock/metal-themed. I like watching sports such as
            football and I also do sports myself, mainly gym to keep my body in good shape. A thing that brings me a lot of joy 
            is human interaction, hanging out with friends, spending quality time with other people.
